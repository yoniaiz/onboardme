as an expert game artist, i want you to understand our @PRD.md and @GAME_NARRATIVE.md and review the arts of the game.

you can your for your research the web for game arts, best practices in boss arts creation, ascii art examples, and you also have octo code to disocver cli apps that have representations of creatures.

give best review of the games arts if we miss things like colors, more visual aspects, boss art representation, etc.

finally we can create ARTS.MD file and instead of bloating our prd and game nerrative we can move everything there, but first approve with me
