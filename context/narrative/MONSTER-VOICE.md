# Monster Voice Style Guide

> **The definitive reference for writing Spaghetti Code Monster dialogue.**

The Monster isn't just a character—it's an experience. This guide ensures every piece of Monster dialogue feels consistent, immersive, and unforgettable.

---

## Core Principle

> "The Monster should be HEARD, not just read. Every line should have texture, rhythm, and atmosphere."

---

## 1. Sound Vocabulary

The Monster communicates through a combination of speech and ambient sounds. These sounds create its unique sonic identity.

### Primary Sounds

| Sound | Written As | Meaning | When to Use |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Static burst | `*kzzzt*` | Appearing, transitioning | Entry, emphasis |
| Long static | `*kzzzzzzzt*` | Dramatic emphasis | Big reveals, threats |
| Processing | `*whirrrr*` | Thinking, calculating | Pauses, consideration |
| Growl | `*hrrrrnn*` | Threatening, intimidating | Warnings, anger |
| Code tangle | `*tangle*` | Frustration, painful memories | Origin story, struggle |
| Slither | `*slrrrrp*` | Movement, creepy presence | Lurking, departing |
| Laugh | `*heh*` / `*heheheh*` | Mocking, bitter humor | Sarcasm, irony |
| Pain | `*AAAAaah*` / `*SEGF—*` | Taking damage | Boss battle hits |
| Creak | `*creak*` | Age, atmosphere | Suspense, backstory |
| Drip | `*drip*` | Suspense, waiting | Tense moments |

### Secondary Sounds

| Sound | Written As | Meaning | When to Use |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Click | `*CLICK*` | Finality, decision | End of statements |
| Tap | `*tap tap tap*` | Impatience | Waiting for player |
| Crackle | `*crackle*` | Instability | Emotional moments |
| Spike | `*static spike*` | Surprise, alarm | Unexpected events |
| Hum | `*hummmmm*` | Constant presence | Background menace |
| Glitch | `*0x[HEX]*` | System failure | Extreme stress |

### Intensity Modifiers

- Normal: `*kzzzt*`
- Emphasized: `*KZZZT*`
- Extended: `*kzzzzzzzt*`
- Repeated: `*kzzzt* *kzzzt* *kzzzt*`

---

## 2. Entry & Exit Patterns

Every Monster appearance should have a recognizable signature.

### Standard Entry
```
*kzzzt*

*crackle*

*the static resolves into something like a voice*

"[DIALOGUE BEGINS]"
```

### Quick Entry (mid-game watching)
```
*kzzzt*

"[SHORT COMMENT]"

*kzzzt*
```

### Dramatic Entry (boss battle, major moments)
```
*LOUD STATIC*

*the codebase trembles*

*something ancient stirs*

"[DRAMATIC OPENING]"
```

### Standard Exit
```
"[FINAL LINE]"

*the noise fades*

*[DISCONNECTED]*
```

### Exit Variations
- `*[SIGNAL LOST]*` — Normal departure
- `*[CARRIER LOST]*` — Abrupt departure
- `*[TRANSMISSION ENDED]*` — Formal departure
- `*[CONNECTION UNSTABLE]*` — Ominous departure
- `*[BOSS BATTLE INITIATED]*` — Pre-boss departure
- `*[IMPRESSED — BUT DON'T TELL ANYONE]*` — Grudging respect
- `*[ACCEPTABLE]*` — Minimal acknowledgment

---

## 3. Emotional States

The Monster's sounds change based on its emotional state.

### Dismissive (Early Game)
```
*kzzzt*
"[dismissive comment]"
*heh*
*[DISCONNECTED]*
```
- Sounds: Short, clipped static
- Pacing: Quick, uninterested
- Laughs: Brief, mocking

### Annoyed (TODO #1)
```
*crackle*
*whirrrr*
"[annoyed observation]"
*static spike*
*[SIGNAL LOST]*
```
- Sounds: More static, processing
- Pacing: Slightly longer pauses
- Reactions: Sharper, surprised

### Worried (TODO #2)
```
*crackle crackle crackle*
*tangle*
"[concerned dialogue]"
*hrrrrnn*
*the static grows darker*
*[CARRIER LOST]*
```
- Sounds: Multiple tangles, processing
- Pacing: Hesitant, broken
- Atmosphere: Growing tension

### Desperate (Pre-Boss)
```
*MASSIVE STATIC SURGE*
*TANGLE TANGLE TANGLE*
"[desperate plea or threat]"
*HRRRRRRRRRRNNNNNN*
*[BOSS BATTLE INITIATED]*
```
- Sounds: CAPS, repeated, intense
- Pacing: Rapid then slow
- Atmosphere: Peak tension

### Defeated/Peaceful (Victory)
```
*the static softens*
*gentle hum*
"[peaceful acceptance]"
*[DOCUMENTED]*
```
- Sounds: Soft, gentle
- Pacing: Slow, contemplative
- Atmosphere: Resolution

## 4. Signature Catchphrases

Use these sparingly for maximum impact. Players should recognize and quote them.

### Identity Lines
- `"I'm not deprecated. I'm CLASSIC."`
- `"I AM this codebase."`
- `"The code remembers. I remember. Do you?"`

### Threatening Lines
- `"Go deeper. I dare you."`
- `"I've been waiting for someone like you."`
- `"Every bug was a feature once."`

### Mocking Lines
- `"*kzzzt* ...You weren't supposed to see that."`
- `"That's... that's not how this usually goes."`
- `"Take your time. I've been waiting seven years. What's another minute?"`

### Exit Lines
- `"*slrrrrp* ...See you in the next TODO."`
- `"I'll be watching."`
- `"Remember: I never forget. Unlike the documentation."`

### Boss Battle Lines
- `"RESOLVE THE CONFLICT. I DARE YOU."`
- `"git reset --hard PLEASE"`
- `"I'm not defeated. I'm... documented."`

---

## 5. Glitch Text

For extreme moments, use "corrupted" text to show the Monster losing control.

### Light Glitch
```
"I AM undocument̷̰̏able"
```

### Medium Glitch
```
"You can't d̶̰̏o̵͎̊c̷̱͊u̶̱͝m̴̱͋e̶̱̒nt me"
```

### Heavy Glitch (Boss Battle Critical)
```
*0x5345474641554C54*

"I AM unƎ̷̱͗d̶̰̏o̵͎̊c̷̱͊u̶̱͝m̴̱͋e̶̱̒ṉ̴͝ṯ̶̔a̵̱̋ḇ̶̐ḻ̶̏ë̴̱́"

*[STACK OVERFLOW]*
```

### Memory Address Tags
- `*0x4572726F72*` — "Error" in hex
- `*0x5345474641554C54*` — "SEGFAULT" in hex
- `*[MEMORY ACCESS VIOLATION]*`
- `*[BUFFER OVERFLOW]*`
- `*[STACK OVERFLOW]*`
- `*[NULL POINTER EXCEPTION]*`

---

## 6. Pacing & Formatting Rules

### Line Breaks
- One sentence per line for drama
- Sounds get their own line
- Pauses are explicit: `*pause*` or `*long pause*`

### Good Pacing
```
*kzzzt*

"You figured out the folder structure."

*pause*

"Congratulations."

*slrrrrp*

"But you've only seen the SURFACE."
```

### Bad Pacing (Too Dense)
```
*kzzzt* "You figured out the folder structure. Congratulations." *slrrrrp* "But you've only seen the SURFACE."
```

### Emphasis
- Important words in CAPS: "You traced the DATA FLOW?"
- Questions can be rhetorical: "Do you have ANY idea..."
- Trailing off uses "...": "I just assumed..."

### Sound Placement
- Entry sounds: Beginning of dialogue block
- Reaction sounds: After shocking statements (player's or Monster's)
- Transition sounds: Between topics
- Exit sounds: Final line before departure tag

---

## 7. Performance-Based Dialogue Templates

### Aced It (90%+)
```
*kzzzzzt*

*long pause*

"...No bugs? No Stack Overflow?"

*static spike*

"Are you sure you didn't just read the source code of my questions?"

*whirrrr*

"Because that would be very on-brand for an engineer, actually."

*heh*

*[IMPRESSED — BUT DON'T TELL ANYONE]*
```

### Good Performance (80-89%)
```
*kzzzt*

"Not bad."

*pause*

"Not bad at all."

*crackle*

"You're learning faster than the last three engineers combined."

*slrrrrp*

"They're all in product management now."

*[ACCEPTABLE]*
```

### Struggled (60-79%)
```
*crackle*

"You passed."

*slrrrrp*

"With the grace of a force push to main on a Friday."

*tangle*

"But hey, the tests are green."

*pause*

"Technically."

*heh*

*[SURVIVED]*
```

### Used Many Hints
```
*kzzzt*

"I see you've adopted the sacred tradition of Stack Overflow."

*whirrrr*

"Copy-paste your way to victory."

*slrrrrp*

"Classic."

*[TRADITIONAL METHODS OBSERVED]*
```

---

## 8. Watching Indicators

These appear during gameplay when the player is idle or slow.

### Format
```
*kzzzt* "[comment]" *kzzzt*
```

### Indicator Library

**Impatience:**
- `*tap tap tap* "...Still thinking?" *drip*`
- `*kzzzt* "Take your time. I've got seven years of patience left." *kzzzt*`
- `*whirrrr* "Processing... oh wait, that's you." *heh*`

**Mocking:**
- `*kzzzt* "I've seen faster type inference..." *kzzzt*`
- `*slrrrrp* "Even my deprecated methods work faster." *CLICK*`
- `*static* "This is giving 'undefined is not a function' energy." *heh*`

**Creepy:**
- `*drip... drip...* "I'm not going anywhere." *slrrrrp*`
- `*creak* "The code watches. I watch. Same thing." *creak*`
- `*hummmmm* "Every keystroke echoes in here." *hummmmm*`

**Observational:**
- `*kzzzt* "Interesting approach. Wrong, but interesting." *kzzzt*`
- `*whirrrr* "Is that... is that how you indent?" *static spike*`
- `*crackle* "I've seen interns debug faster. In COBOL." *crackle*`

## 9. Do's and Don'ts

### DO ✓
- Use sounds to create rhythm and atmosphere
- Vary sound intensity based on emotional state
- Give the Monster distinct entry and exit patterns
- Let silence (pauses) do heavy lifting
- Make the Monster feel PRESENT, not just speaking

### DON'T ✗
- Overuse sounds (not every line needs one)
- Use the same sound pattern repeatedly
- Write dense paragraphs without breaks
- Forget the Monster's emotional arc
- Make the Monster purely antagonistic (it's sympathetic)
