# TODO #3: traceroute --function - Visuals

## Visual Design Notes

This game focuses on tracing data flows. Visual elements should emphasize:

- **Flow visualization** showing data movement through the system
- **Function call chains** displayed clearly
- **File transitions** highlighted as data moves
- **Progress tracking** through the flow trace

## Visual Examples

Visuals for this game should follow the overall aesthetic direction outlined in the PRD's Visual & Aesthetic Direction section, emphasizing:
- Retro-futuristic terminal aesthetic
- Juicy feedback for correct traces
- Professional fun (cool, not cute)
- Flow diagrams that feel like network routing visualization
