## Description

This game teaches players to understand how data flows through the system by tracing it across multiple files and functions. Players learn:

- How data flows through the system
- Error handling patterns
- Debugging workflow
- Testing patterns

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding how data flows through the system
- Knowledge of error handling patterns
- Familiarity with debugging workflow

## Monster Reaction on Completion (Backstory Revealed)

After completing this sub-task (along with the other TODO #3 sub-task), the Monster reveals its backstory:

```
"You want to know how I became this?"

"I was beautiful once. Clean. Single-responsibility."
"A simple function: validateInput(). 12 lines. Elegant."

"Then came the edge cases."
"Then the 'quick fixes.'"
"Then the developer who said 'I'll document this later.'"

"'Later' never came."

"Now I am validateInputAndAlsoCheckAuthAndMaybeLogSometimes()."
"I am 3,000 lines of IF statements."
"I am the monster THEY created."
```
