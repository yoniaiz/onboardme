# TODO #2: import { puzzle } - Visuals

## Visual Design Notes

This game focuses on import pattern understanding. Visual elements should emphasize:

- **Import statement visualization** showing relationships
- **Ordering interface** for arranging imports correctly
- **Pattern highlighting** when correct patterns are identified
- **Dependency graph visualization** showing module relationships

## Visual Examples

Visuals for this game should follow the overall aesthetic direction outlined in the PRD's Visual & Aesthetic Direction section, emphasizing:
- Retro-futuristic terminal aesthetic
- Juicy feedback for correct ordering
- Professional fun (cool, not cute)
