# TODO #3: debug --inject - Visuals

## Visual Design Notes

This game focuses on bug hunting and fixing. Visual elements should emphasize:

- **Error highlighting** showing where bugs are located
- **Code diff visualization** for fixes
- **Before/after comparisons** of buggy vs fixed code
- **Success animations** when bugs are correctly identified and fixed

## Visual Examples

Visuals for this game should follow the overall aesthetic direction outlined in the PRD's Visual & Aesthetic Direction section, emphasizing:
- Retro-futuristic terminal aesthetic
- Juicy feedback for bug fixes
- Professional fun (cool, not cute)
- Error states that feel like actual debugging sessions
