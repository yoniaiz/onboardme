## Description

This game teaches players debugging skills by having them find and fix bugs that have been injected into the codebase. Players learn:

- How data flows through the system
- Error handling patterns
- Debugging workflow
- Testing patterns

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding how data flows through the system
- Knowledge of error handling patterns
- Familiarity with debugging workflow
- Understanding testing patterns

## Game Flow

Players are presented with buggy code or symptoms of bugs and must:
1. Identify where the bug is located
2. Understand why the bug occurs
3. Determine the correct fix
4. Verify the fix works

This builds practical debugging skills and understanding of common error patterns.

## Monster Reaction on Completion (Backstory Revealed)

After completing this sub-task (along with the other TODO #3 sub-task), the Monster reveals its backstory:

```
"You want to know how I became this?"

"I was beautiful once. Clean. Single-responsibility."
"A simple function: validateInput(). 12 lines. Elegant."

"Then came the edge cases."
"Then the 'quick fixes.'"
"Then the developer who said 'I'll document this later.'"

"'Later' never came."

"Now I am validateInputAndAlsoCheckAuthAndMaybeLogSometimes()."
"I am 3,000 lines of IF statements."
"I am the monster THEY created."
```
