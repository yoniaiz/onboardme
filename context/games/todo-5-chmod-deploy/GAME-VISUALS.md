# TODO #5: chmod +x deploy.sh - Visuals

## Visual Design Notes

This game focuses on operational task completion. Visual elements should emphasize:

- **Task presentation** showing operational steps clearly
- **Command execution interface** that feels like real terminal work
- **Progress tracking** through multi-step operations
- **Success/failure feedback** for each step
- **Sandbox safety indicators** showing the environment is safe

## Visual Examples

Visuals for this game should follow the overall aesthetic direction outlined in the PRD's Visual & Aesthetic Direction section, emphasizing:
- Retro-futuristic terminal aesthetic
- Juicy feedback for correct task completion
- Professional fun (cool, not cute)
- Realistic operational interface
