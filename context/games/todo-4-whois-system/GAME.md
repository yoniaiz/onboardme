## Game Overview

**Type:** Guessing from clues  
**Goal:** Identify components from behavioral descriptions  
**Level:** 4 (TODO #4)  
**Sub-task:** First sub-task of TODO #4

## Description

This game teaches players to understand the business domain and architectural decisions by identifying components from behavioral descriptions. Players learn:

- Business domain knowledge
- Architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Why specific patterns are used
- Historical context

## Learning Outcomes

- Business domain knowledge
- Understanding architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Knowledge of why specific patterns are used
- Understanding historical context

## Game Flow

Players are given behavioral descriptions or clues about a component and must identify which component matches those behaviors. This builds understanding of the "why" behind the code, not just the "what".

## Monster Reaction on Completion (Existential Crisis)

After completing this sub-task (along with the other TODO #4 sub-task), the Monster has an existential crisis:

```
"You understand the business logic now."
"The WHY behind the code."
"Even the parts that don't make sense."

"Do you know why retry count is 3?"
"Neither do I."
"The comment says 'DO NOT CHANGE - breaks prod.'"
"Nobody knows why. The knowledge died with the summer intern."

"If you defeat me, who will guard the sacred constants?"
"WHO WILL REMEMBER WHY THE TIMEOUT IS 3847 MILLISECONDS?"
```
