# TODO #4: whois --system - Visuals

## Visual Design Notes

This game focuses on identifying components from clues. Visual elements should emphasize:

- **Clue presentation** in a mysterious, investigative format
- **Component identification interface** for making guesses
- **Reveal animations** when correct components are identified
- **Contextual information** about why components work the way they do

## Visual Examples

Visuals for this game should follow the overall aesthetic direction outlined in the PRD's Visual & Aesthetic Direction section, emphasizing:
- Retro-futuristic terminal aesthetic
- Juicy feedback for correct identifications
- Professional fun (cool, not cute)
- Mystery-solving atmosphere
