# TODO #1: tree --discover - Visuals

## Visual Design Notes

This game focuses on progressive revelation of project structure. Visual elements should emphasize:

- **Discovery animations** as new parts of the structure are revealed
- **Tree-like visualization** of directory structure
- **Progressive highlighting** of discovered components
- **Clean, organized presentation** of the codebase structure

## Visual Examples

Visuals for this game should follow the overall aesthetic direction outlined in the PRD's Visual & Aesthetic Direction section, emphasizing:
- Retro-futuristic terminal aesthetic
- Juicy feedback for discoveries
- Professional fun (cool, not cute)
