## Monster Reaction on Completion (Existential Crisis)

After completing this sub-task (along with the other TODO #4 sub-task), the Monster has an existential crisis:

```
"You understand the business logic now."
"The WHY behind the code."
"Even the parts that don't make sense."

"Do you know why retry count is 3?"
"Neither do I."
"The comment says 'DO NOT CHANGE - breaks prod.'"
"Nobody knows why. The knowledge died with the summer intern."

"If you defeat me, who will guard the sacred constants?"
"WHO WILL REMEMBER WHY THE TIMEOUT IS 3847 MILLISECONDS?"
```
