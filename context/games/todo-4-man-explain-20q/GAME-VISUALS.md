# TODO #4: man --explain 20q - Visuals

## Visual Design Notes

This game focuses on deduction through questions. Visual elements should emphasize:

- **Question counter** showing remaining questions (20 total)
- **Answer display** (Yes/No) with clear formatting
- **Deduction progress** showing narrowing down of possibilities
- **Final reveal** when the correct function/concept is identified

## Visual Examples

Visuals for this game should follow the overall aesthetic direction outlined in the PRD's Visual & Aesthetic Direction section, emphasizing:
- Retro-futuristic terminal aesthetic
- Juicy feedback for correct deductions
- Professional fun (cool, not cute)
- Interactive question-answer format
