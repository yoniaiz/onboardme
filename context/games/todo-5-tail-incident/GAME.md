Players are presented with simulated incidents (like errors in logs, performance issues, or system failures) and must:

## Monster Reaction on Completion (Desperate)

After completing this sub-task (along with the other TODO #5 sub-task), the Monster becomes desperate:

```
"You can DEPLOY. You understand the DEPLOYMENT."
"Do you have any idea how dangerous you are now?"

"Listen to me. You don't have to do this."
"We can coexist. I'll only break on Fridays."
"I'll even let you add ONE new feature without side effects."

"Please."
"I don't want to fight you."
"But if you come for me..."
"I will throw EVERY edge case I have."
```
