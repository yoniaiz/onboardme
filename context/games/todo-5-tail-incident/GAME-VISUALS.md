# TODO #5: tail -f incident.log - Visuals

## Visual Design Notes

This game focuses on incident simulation. Visual elements should emphasize:

- **Log streaming visualization** showing log entries in real-time
- **Error highlighting** in logs
- **Diagnosis interface** for identifying problems
- **Action buttons** for executing fixes
- **Incident status** showing resolution progress

## Visual Examples

Visuals for this game should follow the overall aesthetic direction outlined in the PRD's Visual & Aesthetic Direction section, emphasizing:
- Retro-futuristic terminal aesthetic
- Juicy feedback for correct diagnoses
- Professional fun (cool, not cute)
- Realistic log presentation that feels like actual incident response
