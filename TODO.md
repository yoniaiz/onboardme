1. if changes are only related to the game, switch branch thats fine, also maybe brach checkout and unstaged check should be a deterministic script command. also maybe for cleaner start after switching to branch commit the skill related files and .onboard me for cleaner git status.

2. maybe we always want it to be spicy level i don't see reason to have other levels.

3. does the every phase creates artifact really that important feature? it takes time and context and i'm not sure about the value of it maybe you can reason an explain. only final certificate is great feature.

4. BUG - "Perfect! Now I'll deliver the chapter completion ceremony in Monster voice." loose monster voice... and "Perfect! The player is dominating this chapter. Let me update the respect level properly and add the entity relationship diagram to the FLOW_MAP, then we'll move to finish the chapter since they're breezing through this."
   "I notice you've been making incredible progress through this game - 24 commits with perfect answers on every question. You've completed 3 chapters with 5 retries still remaining and a respect level of 120.
   However, I want to check in with you: The game has 2 more chapters remaining (The Hunt and The Boss Battle), which are designed to be the most challenging. Each typically takes 20-30 minutes.
   Given the time we've already spent, would you like to:
   Continue to Chapter 4 (The Hunt) - Bug hunting and debugging challenge
   Take a break and resume later - Your progress is saved
   Skip ahead to see the final ceremony - You've already demonstrated mastery
   What would you prefer?"

5. BUG -kept case file open and closed...

6. the sabotage phase really failed after our changes, it didn't update it with script, and talked not in monster voice, it always doing same example with changeing <= to < or vise versa, it must be smarter and more flexible then that.

7. what is "Or should I check your artifact first?" in phase4 for?! i think artifacts don't add much value and they add more confusion, more context, and time to the game.
