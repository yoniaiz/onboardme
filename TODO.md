1. why do we create state and state backup?

2. level two asked for adding feature? not that i didn't like it but i thought this is the boss level.

3. boss level didn't start...

4. didn't show memories and tracked progress, we might have to complicated instructions and it cuasing the agent to be confused. maybe we have even conflicts, we must simplify and make sure we are on track.

5. it didn't generate final certificate. ( the new feature )
