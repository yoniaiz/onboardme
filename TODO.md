1. the "say start game" if possible would be great to not require it, if skill loaded automatically start the game

2. as i already mentioned i would like it to recognize skill only related files and just automatically checkout and then commit them.

3. why its always runs update-mood deep?

4. i think we should have more "clear are you ready for next phase?" message

5. it keeps to pause without having a flow of continuing to next challenge, users that are not familiar with the game might get confused.

6. for some reason the agent really struggle in phase4 to do sabotage with a script, is there any way to improve it? also it still always doing same example with changing <= to < or vise versa, it must be smarter and more flexible then that.

7. boss phase did ask first to explain the plan for the feature, also not sure where did this format came from, and phase4 just finished and skipped?

8. might have been some error running the update state script?

9. the boss level feels to me like it requests a feature without validating the it does not exists, or even partially, it saying something like missing feature but actually it sometimes partially exists maybe just not exactly as monster wanted it.

10. phase 4-5 again because of the summary completely was wrong and did very bad results there, not clear at all why this flow happened this way we must think of a strategy to overcome this chat summary.
    we must be creative, have more state files, maybe hooks, better rules, maybe more validations, think of something.
